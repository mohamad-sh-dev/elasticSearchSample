**Project Name: Node.js CRUD for Elasticsearch Blogs**

#### This project just a sample for how to config use elastic search integrate with nodejs, so please don't be too strict about how to write code and validations

**Description**

This Node.js project empowers you to manage blog posts within an Elasticsearch cluster, offering CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality along with advanced search capabilities.

**Prerequisites**

- Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed on your development machine.
- A running Elasticsearch cluster. You can download and install Elasticsearch from the official website: [https://www.elastic.co/downloads/elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/downloads/elasticsearch)

**Installation**

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://your-github-repo-url.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd nodejs-elasticsearch-blogs
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

**Configuration**

- Create a file named `.env` in the project root directory (**important: exclude this file from version control**).
- Add the following environment variables to `.env`, replacing placeholders with your actual Elasticsearch connection details:

   ```
   ELASTICSEARCH_HOST=localhost
   ELASTICSEARCH_PORT=9200
   ELASTICSEARCH_INDEX=blogs  # Name of the Elasticsearch index for your blogs
   ```

**Usage**

This project provides a Node.js script (`index.js`) that exports functions for CRUD and search operations on blogs. You can import these functions into your application or use the script directly on the command line.

**1. Using the Script (Command Line):**

```bash
node index.js <command> [options]

Available commands:

  createBlog      - Creates a new blog post
  getBlogs        - Retrieves all blog posts (optionally filtered by query)
  searchByTitle   - Searches for blog posts by title (supports partial matches)
  removeBlog      - Deletes a blog post
  searchMultiField - Searches across multiple fields (title, content)
  searchByRegexp   - Searches using regular expressions (field and pattern required)
  searchByRegexpMultiField - Searches with regex across multiple fields
  updateBlog      - Updates an existing blog post
```

For each command, refer to the script itself or additional documentation within the project for specific usage instructions and options.

**2. Using Functions in Your Application:**

```javascript
const { createBlog, getBlogs, // ... other functions } = require('./index');

// Example: Create a new blog post
createBlog({ title: 'My New Blog Post', content: 'This is the content of my post.' })
  .then(() => console.log('Blog post created successfully!'))
  .catch(error => console.error('Error creating blog post:', error));
```

**Additional Notes**

- The project leverages the `@elastic/elasticsearch` library for interacting with Elasticsearch.
- Error handling and logging are essential aspects of real-world applications, so consider incorporating error handling mechanisms and logging libraries into your project.
- This README provides a foundational structure. As your project evolves, feel free to enhance it with more detailed instructions, code examples, and best practices.
